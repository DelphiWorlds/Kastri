# Connectivity Demo

This demo shows how you can check whether a device has an internet connection, and if such a connection is via Wifi

### Supported Delphi versions

The demo should compile and work for at least versions 10.3.3, 10.4.x and 11.x

### Supported Platforms

Supported platforms are Windows, macOS, iOS and Android

### Compiling the demo
Note that this demo, like most others here, are dependent on other files in the [Kastri repository](https://github.com/DelphiWorlds/Kastri). Please either download, or clone Kastri (using a git-based version control client) 

### Compiling for macOS and/or iOS

Depending on your version of Delphi, you may need to add the SystemConfiguration framework to the macOS and/or iOS SDK. There are some instructions on [how to add a framework here](https://delphiworlds.com/2013/10/adding-other-ios-frameworks-to-the-sdk-manager) (needs updating, however it should still work)
