# macOS Status Bar Demo

## Description

Demonstrates the use of `TStatusBarMenu`  in `Core\DW.StatusBarMenu.Mac.pas`.

Apologies for the lack of documentation, however the recommended solution is to now use `TPlatformMenu`, which is described in the [macOS Menu Bar demo](../macOSMenuBar).

## Supported Delphi versions

Delphi 12, Delphi 11.x. It _may_ also work in Delphi 10.4.2, and perhaps earlier.
