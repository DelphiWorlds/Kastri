# PDF View Demo

## Description

This demonstrates the use of TPDFControl, found in the DW.PDFControl unit, in the Features\AndroidPDF folder

The control is useful on Android only, as it is platform specific, however the demo shows how a TWebBrowser component can be used on other platforms, in place of TPDFControl.

TPDFControl simply renders the pages of the PDF, and provides page count and page numbers. **Zoom/Pan is yet to be implemented.**

## Supported Delphi versions

The demo should compile and work for at least versions 10.4.x and 11.x
