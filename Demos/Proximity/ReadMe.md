# Proximity Demo

This demo implements the proximity detector on mobile devices. It can be useful for apps where the user may place the device up to their ear (for whatever reason)

Run the app, and place your hand over the proximity detector (usually at the top of the device) - the screen should turn off, then turn on again when you move your hand away

### Supported Delphi versions

The demo should compile and work for Delphi 12, Delphi 11.x, Delphi 10.4.x and possibly earlier

### Supported Platforms

Supported platforms are iOS and Android

### Using Proximity in your own app

On Android, please ensure that the Wake Lock permission is set in the Uses Permissions section of the Project Options for your app
