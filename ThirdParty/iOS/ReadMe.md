# iOS Frameworks

This folder contains frameworks and libraries that may not normally have binary distributions. 

They were built from source using Xcode, using an iOS framework project that has the respective [cocoa pods](https://cocoapods.org/) added to it. [This is a guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html) as to how you can add cocoa pods to an Xcode project.
